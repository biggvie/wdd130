    <h1>Welcome to WDD 130.</h1>
    <p>👋 Hi, I’m Vitalis Ugwumba — a passionate developer, problem solver, and lifelong learner.
        I love turning ideas into elegant, efficient code and creating digital experiences that make an impact. I
        currently reside in Yola town, Yola is the capital city of **Adamawa State**, located in northeastern
        **Nigeria**, along the **Benue River**. The town
        is divided into two main parts — **Jimeta**, which serves as the commercial center, and **Old Yola**, which
        houses the
        administrative and traditional institutions. Yola is known for its warm hospitality, rich Fulani culture, and
        historical
        significance as the seat of the **Lamido of Adamawa**.

        Surrounding Yola are several notable natural habitats and geographical features. The **Mandara Mountains**, a
        picturesque range extending along the Nigeria–Cameroon border, lie about **95–100 kilometers east of Yola**.
        Closer to
        the town, the **Song Valley**, located roughly **35 kilometers north of Yola**, provides scenic views and
        fertile land
        for agriculture. Additionally, the **Benue River**, which flows just south of Yola, contributes to the area’s
        lush
        vegetation and supports local fishing and farming communities.
